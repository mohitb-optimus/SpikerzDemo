# Spikerz Demo Assessment with Playwright and Typescript

This project is a Playwright + TypeScript test automation framework with session management and Allure reporting.

## Features

- Playwright test runner with TypeScript
- Session authentication using storage state (`auth.json`)
- Allure reporting integration
- Modular page object structure
- Environment variable support via `.env`

## Overview of Architectural Choices

‚úÖ Playwright + TypeScript test runner: modern, fast E2E with type safety. Your config is centralized in playwright.config.ts.
‚úÖ Session authentication via storage state: login state is persisted in auth.json, reducing repeated UI logins and speeding up suites.
‚úÖ Modular Page Object Model (POM): page objects live under tests/pages/, with shared core utilities under tests/core/ for reuse and maintainability.
‚úÖ Environment-driven configuration: .env variables (exposed through tests/utils/env.ts) allow easy switching across environments without code edits.
‚úÖ Dual reporting: Playwright‚Äôs built-in HTML report for quick local debugging, plus Allure for rich, shareable, historical reporting.
‚úÖ HTTP Basic Auth login management
‚úÖ Reusable helpers (safeClick, safeFill, safeType, safeGoto, safeWaitForSelector, safeWaitForResponse)
‚úÖ Dockerized test execution
‚úÖ CI/CD via GitHub Actions
‚úÖ Automatic report hosting on GitHub Pages

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (for local development)
- A valid Google/YouTube account
- Access to the Spikerz platform
- Docker

## Project Structure

- `tests/` - Test specs, page objects, core utilities
- `playwright.config.ts` - Playwright configuration
- `auth.json` - Storage state for authentication/session
- `allure-report/` & `allure-results/` - Allure reporting output
- `playwright-report/` - Playwright HTML report output

## Scripts

| Command         | Description                              |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| `npm test`      | Run all Playwright tests                 |
| `npm run test:headed` | Run tests in headed mode           |
| `npm run test:ui`     | Launch Playwright test UI          |
| `npm run build` | Compile TypeScript                      |
| `npm run clean` | Remove test and report output folders    |

## Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure environment variables in `.env` (optional).

3. Run tests:

   ```sh
   npm test
   ```

## Reporting

- Allure results are generated in `allure-results/`:

1. Generate Allure Report

    ```sh
   npx allure generate ./allure-results --clean -o ./allure-report
   ```

2. Open Allure Report

   ```sh
   npx allure open ./allure-report
   ```

- HTML reports are in `playwright-report/`.

## Customization

- Update test credentials and URLs in [`tests/utils/env.ts`](tests/utils/env.ts).
- Add new page objects in [`tests/pages/`](tests/pages/).
- Extend session management in [`tests/core/`](tests/core/).

## Environment Variables

Create a .env.local file with the following variables:

DEMO_URL=<https://demo.spikerz.com>
DEMO_USERNAME=your_site_username
DEMO_PASSWORD=your_site_password
GMAIL_USER=your_google_email
GMAIL_PASSWORD=your_google_password

## üê≥ Running with Docker

1Ô∏è‚É£ Build Docker Image

From project root:

```sh
docker build -t spikerzdemo .
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Run Tests in Docker

Run all Playwright tests:

```sh
docker run --rm spikerzdemo
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Save Reports to Host

To persist reports (playwright-report/, allure-report/):

```sh
docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/test-results:/app/test-results \
  -v $(pwd)/allure-results:/app/allure-results \
  -v $(pwd)/allure-report:/app/allure-report \
  -v $(pwd)/playwright-report:/app/playwright-report \
  spikerzdemo
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ View Reports Locally

Playwright HTML report:

```sh
./playwright-report/index.html
```

Allure report:

```sh
./allure-report/index.html
```

## ‚ö° CI/CD with GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/tests.yml) will:

1. Build Docker image
2. Run Playwright tests inside container
3. Generate static Playwright + Allure reports
4. Upload reports as artifacts
5. Deploy reports to GitHub Pages

## üåê GitHub Pages Reports

After each CI/CD run, reports are available online:

- Playwright Report ‚Üí
https://<`your-username`>.github.io/<`your-repo`>/playwright-report/

- Allure Report ‚Üí
https://<`your-username`>.github.io/<`your-repo`>/allure-report/

Enable Pages:

- Repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Source = gh-pages branch.

## Troubleshooting

- If the automation fails, check the API response for detailed error messages
- Verify that your environment variables are correctly set
- Ensure your Google account doesn't have 2FA enabled, or use an app password
