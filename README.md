## üê≥ Running with Docker

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Build Docker Image

```sh
docker build -t spikerzdemo .
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run Tests in Docker

```sh
docker run --rm \
  -e DEMO_USERNAME=myuser \
  -e DEMO_PASSWORD=mypass \
  -e GMAIL_USER=mygmail \
  -e GMAIL_PASSWORD=mygmailpass \
  -e DEMO_URL=https://demo.spikerz.com \
  -v $(pwd)/test-results:/app/test-results \
  -v $(pwd)/allure-results:/app/allure-results \
  -v $(pwd)/allure-report:/app/allure-report \
  -v $(pwd)/playwright-report:/app/playwright-report \
  spikerzdemo \
  npx playwright test --reporter=line,allure-playwright,html
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ View Reports Locally

* **Playwright HTML report:**
  `./playwright-report/index.html`

* **Allure report:**
  `./allure-report/index.html`

---

## ‚ö° CI/CD with GitHub Actions

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`) will:

1. Build Docker image
2. Run Playwright tests inside container
3. Generate static Playwright + Allure reports
4. Upload reports as artifacts
5. Deploy reports to GitHub Pages

---

## üåê GitHub Pages Reports

After each CI/CD run, reports are hosted at:

* **Playwright Report** ‚Üí
  `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>/reports/playwright-report/`

* **Allure Report** ‚Üí
  `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>/reports/allure-report/`

Enable Pages in GitHub:
**Repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Source = gh-pages branch.**

---

## üêû Debugging Failures with Playwright Artifacts

When a test fails, GitHub Actions automatically uploads useful artifacts:

- **`test-results/`** ‚Üí contains raw Playwright outputs:
  - `trace.zip` ‚Üí Full timeline of the test (steps, DOM snapshots, console logs, network traffic).
  - `.png` screenshots ‚Üí Captures the state of the page at failure.
  - `.webm` videos ‚Üí Replay the entire browser session.

- **`playwright-report/`** ‚Üí Static HTML report showing all steps.
- **`allure-report/`** ‚Üí Historical report with trends and categories.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Replaying a Trace

To investigate a failure:

1. Download the **`test-results` artifact** from GitHub Actions.
2. Locate the `trace.zip` file inside the failed test folder.
3. Open it locally with:

   ```sh
   npx playwright show-trace trace.zip




## ‚úÖ Summary

* **Locally** ‚Üí Run via Docker, view reports in `index.html`
* **CI/CD** ‚Üí Runs on push/PR, reports deployed to GitHub Pages
* **Artifacts** ‚Üí Debug failures with screenshots, traces, logs
* **Reports** ‚Üí Playwright + Allure for complete visibility
